Attendance Management System Outline

1. Project Description

The Attendance Management System is a mobile and web-based application designed to streamline the process of marking and tracking student attendance. It provides teachers with an easy-to-use interface for recording attendance and enables students to view their attendance records in real time. The system is built to be efficient, user-friendly, and accessible on multiple platforms.

2. Problem Addressing

Traditional attendance systems rely on manual record-keeping, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This project aims to address these issues by providing an automated system that ensures accuracy, reduces administrative workload, and provides real-time updates.

The Attendance Management System automates the attendance tracking process, reducing human errors and increasing efficiency. Teachers can log in to mark attendance for students, while students can access their records. The system integrates Firebase Authentication for secure logins and Firestore for real-time data storage.
