The Attendance Management System is a mobile and web-based application designed to streamline the process of marking and tracking student attendance. It provides teachers with an easy-to-use interface for recording attendance and enables students to view their attendance records in real time. The system is built to be efficient, user-friendly, and accessible on multiple platforms.
2. Problem Addressing
Traditional attendance systems rely on manual record-keeping, which can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This project aims to address these issues by providing an automated system that ensures accuracy, reduces administrative workload, and provides real-time updates.
